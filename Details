*** DETAILS ***

In this section, our aim is to compare the three testing methods for the single sample test of Population proportion.
We are comparing the test statistic from mainly two perspectives : 
1. Power Comparison
2. Comparison using ARE (Asymptotic Relative Efficiency)

****************************************************************************************************
Below, we are giving the file names in this branch and also writing the contents within it beside.
****************************************************************************************************
1.Power_BinProp.R       : This file contains all the codes of power comparison.
2.Comparing_BinProp.R   : The power curves obtained from the previous file are not easily interpretable. 
                          That's why, in this file we have considered another graphical representation so 
                          that we can compare the three testing methods.
3.ARE_BinProp.R         : This file contains all the codes of functions for finding the ARE of the concerned testing methods.
4.Consistent_BinProp.R  : In this file, the three testing methods are compared from the perspective of "Consistency".
5.Convergence_BinProp.R : This file contains the codes related to "Convergence" of the test statistic of the three 
                          testing methods to normality and also the visulization using QQ plot.

[ Here, we have considered four values of sample sizes (n) viz. 10,30,50 and 100.
"m" denotes the simulation number which is fixed at 5000 throughout the project. ]



*********** Images for Power comparisons ***********
## Images whose name starts from Image1 to Image10 denotes the "Power curves". ##
Here are total of 10 images. Image number is given in the first portion of the name of the respective image.

Note : Image 1 and Image 2 gives the combined power curves for all n=10,30,50 and 100. 
       After that till Image 10, there are power curves seperately for each n.

- After "Image No.", there is written "Left" or "Right" which indicates the power curves are obtained from left or right tailed test.
- After there is written "m5" which denotes the simulation number which is fixed at 5000.
- At last "nk" is written which indicates "k" is the number of samples taken where, k=10,30,50 and 100.



*********** Images for another graphical representation ************
## Images whose name starts from Images11 to Images16 denotes the "difference of power curves".
- After "Image No.", there is written "Left" or "Right" which indicates the power curves are obtained from left or right tailed test.
- After that, "diff" is written which identifies that this is a plot related to difference of powers.
- After that, there is written "GtVst" or "VstVstm" or "GtVstm" which indicates the following : 
  a. GtVst   : It indicates that we have plotted the difference of powers from "test based on General theory" and "test based on VST".
  b. VstVstm : It indicates that we have plotted the difference of powers from "test based on VST" and "test based on modified VST".
  c. GtVstm  : It indicates that we have plotted the difference of powers from "test based on General theory" and "test based on modified VST".



*********** Images related to Consistency ************
## Images whose name starts from Images17 to Images22 are in this part.
- After "Image No.", there is written "Cons" which denotes that the image is related to consistency of the test.
- Then, there is written "Left" or "Right" which indicates the power curves are obtained from left or right tailed test.
- After that, there is written "Gt","Vst" and "Vstm" which carry their usual meaning as stated above.



************ Images related to Convergence of test statistics **************
Here we have shown the QQ plot of all the three testing methods for the alternative 0.10,0.40,0.60 and 0.90.
## Images whose name starts from Images23 to Images26 are in this part.

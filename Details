In this section, our aim is to compare the three testing methods for the single sample test of Population proportion.
We are comparing the test statistic from mainly two perspectives : 
1. Power Comparison
2. Comparison using ARE (Asymptotic Relative Efficiency)

Below, we are giving the file names in this branch and also writing the contents within it beside.
****************************************************************************************************
1.Power_BinProp.R : This file contains all the codes of power comparison.
2.Comparing_BinProp.R : The power curves obtained from the previous file are not easily interpretable. That's why, in this file we have considered 
another graphical representation so that we can compare the three testing methods.
3.ARE_BinProp.R : This file contains all the codes of functions for finding the ARE of the concerned testing methods.
4.Consistent_BinProp.R : In this file, the three testing methods are compared from the perspective of "Consistency".
5.Convergence_BinProp.R : This file contains the codes related to "Convergence" of the test statistic of the three testing methods to normality and also the visulization using QQ plot.

The project mainly aims to compare the three different large sample testing procedures
 stated before used in the field of large sample theory for the single sampling testing of the
 followings:
 I. Population proportion (p)
 II. Correlation coefficient (ρ) of a bivariate normal population
 The whole comparison is based on running simulations from the corresponding distribution
 for a particular single sampling test.
 [Tests based on simulation : The tests which are based on simulated data are
 known as Simulated tests. Here we generate a data for a random variable with a known
 probability distribution under the null hypothesis and from this simulated data we proceed
 to our hypothesis testing. ]
 The main objectives covered in this project are:
 • Calculating asymptotic powers of the three different testing methods for the above
 two concerned tests for varying values of sample size and comparing them using
 power curves.
 Here the selected sample sizes are 10,30,50 and 100.
 • Finding the number of least sample sizes for each of the testing method and comparing
 them by calculating the respective ARE.
 • Comparing the convergence of the test statistics of the three large sample testing
 methods to normality for the above two tests.
 • Checking the other properties of a test like consistency of a test.

The project mainly aims to compare the **three different large sample testing procedures**
 stated before used in the field of large sample theory for the single sampling testing of the
 followings:
 - ${\color{green}Population \space proportion (p)}$
 - ${\color{green}Correlation \space coefficient (ρ) \space of\space a \space bivariate \space normal \space population}$
 > [!IMPORTANT]  
 The whole comparison is based on running simulations from the corresponding distribution
 for a particular single sampling test.
 The main objectives covered in this project are:
 * Calculating ${\color{violet} asymptotic \space powers }$ of the three different testing methods for the above
 two concerned tests for varying values of sample size and comparing them using
 power curves.
 Here the selected sample sizes are 10,30,50 and 100.
 * Finding the number of least sample sizes for each of the testing method and comparing
 them by calculating the respective ${\color{brown}ARE}$.
 * Comparing the ${\color{#c5f015}convergence}$ of the test statistics of the three large sample testing
 methods to normality for the above two tests.
 * Checking the other properties of a test like ${\color{orange}consistency}$ of a test.


> [!NOTE]
This project is divided in several sections.There is a **main** branch.
From this **main** branch, several branches, (say, sub-branches) have come out where each of the branch denotes a particular **section** of this project.
From the name of the branch, you can easily understand that which section we are going to discuss in that branch.
Within each of the sub-branch, there is a file named ${\color{cyan}*details}$.
